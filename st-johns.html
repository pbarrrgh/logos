St. John's University in New York originally used 'Redmen' as the nickname for its athletic teams. In 1955 the school introduced a cartoonish drawing of a Native American in a headdress dribbling a ball as an alternate logo for its basketball team.
</p><p>
In 1980 the school dropped the image of the Native American, replacing it with a stylized rendering of a more-anonymous basketball-playing figure. The school continued to use the Redmen nickname.

In 1994 the school, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/sports/call-st-john-s-the-red-storm.html" target="_blank">under pressure</a> from outside groups, decided to change its nickname as well. The school's athletic teams are now known as the Red Storm.
