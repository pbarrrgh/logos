Florida State University athletic teams have used the 'Seminole' nickname since 1947. The school adopted a profile illustration of a Native American in 1976 and that same logo has been in use ever since.
</p><p>
The school has introduced numerous alternate logos featuring Native American imagery over the years, including several rendering of a Seminole spear and spear-tip. Chief Osceola, a Native American mascot, was introduced in 1978 and regularly appears at the school's events riding a mascot horse called Renegade.
</p><p>
The school was placed on a list of universities using imagery deemed "hostile or abusive" toward Native Americans by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 2005. Florida State, however, petitioned to be able to retain its logo and mascots,  and sought permission to use its iconography from the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The Tribe <a href="http://www.fsu.edu/news/2005/06/17/seminole.support/" target="_blank">passed a resolution</a> in 2005 granting the school its approval of the logo and mascots.
</p><p>
The NCAA, in turn, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2005-08-23-fsu-mascot-approved_x.htm" target="_blank">granted Florida State a waiver</a> allowing it to continue to use its Seminole-head logo and mascots.
