The Milwaukee Braves introduced a logo featuring a screaming Native American, known as Chief Noc-A-Homa, in 1956. The team retained this logo when they relocated to Atlanta prior to the start of the 1966 season.
</p><p>
Chief Noc-A-Homa also served as the team's mascot in both Milwaukee and Atlanta. The team's stadium in both locations featured an elevated teepee in which Noc-A-Homa resided during games, emerging to dance whenever the Braves hit a home run.
</p><p>
This logo was retired after the 1989 season, replaced by an image of a tomahawk, which the team uses to this day. Chief Noc-A-Homa has also been dropped as a mascot, though the Braves still employ other Native American iconography and symbols. Crowds at home games often chant and swing their arms in a 'tomahawk chop,' which has from time to time aroused controversy, notably <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9510/mascot_protest/" target="_blank">during the 1995 World Series</a>, which pitted the Braves against the Cleveland Indians.
